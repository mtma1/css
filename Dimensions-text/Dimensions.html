            Decide what the main topic of the paragraph will be. Before you begin writing your paragraph, you must have a clear idea of what the paragraph will be about. 
            This is because a paragraph is essentially a collection of sentences that all relate to one central topic.[1] Without a definite idea of what the main topic is,
             your paragraph will lack focus and unity. To determine the exact topic of your paragraph, you should ask yourself many questions:
            What is the prompt I have been given? If you are writing a paragraph as a response or answer to a particular prompt, such as "You have 
            decided to donate money to charity. Which charity do you choose and why?" or "Describe your favorite day of the week," you will need to think 
            carefully about that prompt and make sure you are directly addressing it, rather than going off-topic.
            What are the main ideas or topics that I need to address? Think about the topic you are being asked or have decided to write about, and consider 
            what the most relevant ideas or s relating to that topic are. As paragraphs are usually relatively short, it is important that you try to hit on all the main ideas
            , without going off-topic.
            Who am I writing for? Think about whom the intended readership of this paragraph or paper will be. What is their prior knowledge? Are they familiar with the topic at hand, 
            or will it require many explanatory sentences?
            If your paragraphs are part of a larger essay, writing an essay outline can help you define the major ideas or goals of each paragraph.
